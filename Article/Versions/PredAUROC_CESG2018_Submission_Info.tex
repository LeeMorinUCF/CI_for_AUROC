Abstract

There are several approaches to quantify the variability of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) to measure the predictive performance of a binary classification model. These methods typically involve calculating the variance of the estimate and calculating a z-statistic, under specified distributional assumptions to characterize sampling variability.

In contrast, this paper proposes an approach to characterize variability in the AUROC by allowing for additional variation in the sampling distribution. This additional variation corresponds to changes in the population over time. Then, the variation is quantified by measuring the distance between joint distributions of subsamples from that of the full sample. This provides an estimate of an interval for forecasting the value of the AUROC to be expected in future applications of the model.
